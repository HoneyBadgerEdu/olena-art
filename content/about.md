[Intro]\
C minor, put it in C minor

[Verse 1]\
Where have all the good men gone\
And where are all the gods?\
Where's the street-wise Hercules\
To fight the rising odds?\
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?\
Late at night I toss and I turn and I dream\
Of what I need

[Chorus]\
I need a hero!\
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night\
He's gotta be strong\
And he's gotta be fast\
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight\
I need a hero!\
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light\
He's gotta be sure\
And it's gotta be soon\
And he's gotta be larger than life\
Larger than life
